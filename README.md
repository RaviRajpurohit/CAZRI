We have a short project by CAZRI for keeping an inventory of plants in various nurseries supported by CAZRI, across Jodhpur district.

Pages have to be created for use by nursery staff and administrator to keep a stock of plant species. This inventory can be modified for individual nurseries by their respective staff only using their designated login.

The administrator should be able to change the values/prices etc. as well as generate individual/consolidated report of sale made/items added during a time duration.

The technology to be used shall be a combination of PHP, JS, HTML5 and MySQL.

I'm working on this project under guidance of <b>Gaurav Sir</b> from <a href="http://rrscw.nrsc.gov.in/" target="_blank"><b>Regional Remote Sensing Centre - West</b></a> under the <a href="http://www.isro.gov.in/" target="_blank"><b>ISRO</b></a> Headquarters.

<b>Thank you</br></b>
